# Contributing

The UBC Sauder Capstone project is an open source project,
and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
- new lessons,
- fixes to existing material,
- bug reports,
- and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under our license.
In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can.  
Everyone involved in the development of UBC Sauder Capstone agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

As a **contributor**, you should:

- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account (make sure it remains private!)
- Make your changes in a branch of this fork.
- When these changes are done, make a new branch in the master repository with a descriptive name and add your completed features.
- Ensure that all features have passing tests.
- Submit a pull request from your branch to the master branch.
- Please keep the commit message concise and clear 


When merging the pull request, please:

- Don't merge your own pull request (we want other contributors to review your work)
- Review all the changes before merging
- If there are several commits with the same message, choose [Squash the commits into one commit](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)



For **others:**

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error.

1. You can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/capstone-sauder-2018/issues). This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

2.  You can submit a pull request (PR).

## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new pieces of code and improving existing ones to updating or filling in the documentation and submitting [bug reports](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/capstone-sauder-2018/issues) about things that don't work, aren't clear, or are missing.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are welcomed: we are smarter together than we are on our own.   

Feedback is appreciated and encouraged as the project is continually evolving to better serve the community.
